\section{Running Multics nowadays}

Creating a Multics system or machine nowadays is a bit sketchy process. Since Multics is relying on designated hardware 
such as HIS-645 or 6180 processors (developed by Honeywell) it is not an easy task to do.
You can not simply create \textit{Virtual Machine} from from disk image (ISO). But there are still some options how to do it, 
you can use \textit{simulator/emulator} for such a task. 

MIT in cooperation with BULL runs \href{https://web.mit.edu/multics-history/source/Multics_Internet_Server/Multics_sources.html}{Multics Internet Server} \cite{mitBull}
containing edition of Multics software and documentation, which is useful if you want to try PL/I and rest locally.


\subsection{DPS8-Simulator}

I came across project which still maintain love and desire for running Multics system.
\textbf{RingZero - Multics Reborn} \cite{ringzero} project, created by \textit{Harry Reed} and \textit{Charles Anthony} which is available for 
public \href{http://ringzero.wikidot.com/}{download}. Development takes place on \href{https://gitlab.com/dps8m/dps8m}{GitLab}. 
They provide \textit{DPS8-M simulator}. Still with no much capabilities, but as stated milestone from 11. August 2014:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{Multics reborn! The dps-8/m SIMH-based simulator booted Multics MR 12.5, came to operator command level, entered 
admin mode, created a small PL/I program, compiled and executed it, and shut down.} \cite{ringzero}
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{How to run Multics on GNU\textbackslash Linux}

Detailed process can be found \href{http://multics-wiki.swenson.org/index.php/Main_Page}{Swenson's Multics Wiki} \cite{setupRingZero}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{http://ringzero.wikidot.com/r2-0-load-and-go}{Download} \textit{Pre-built executable} (so we do not need to build simulator from source).
    \item \href{https://s3.amazonaws.com/eswenson-multics/public/releases/MR12.6f/QuickStart_MR12.6f.zip}{Download} "QuickStar RLV", which provides and already Multics system disk image that is ready to run.
    \item Unzip both archives and put in the same directory in system. Go to directory in terminal and:
\end{enumerate}

Your Multics system is up and running. The terminal shell in which you started the simulator and Multics is now the operator console.


The simulator should be listing on TCP port 6180 and if you connect to that port using telnet, you should be able to login. 

\begin{lstlisting}
$> telnet localhost 6180

telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused

M->         # you can start using Multics
\end{lstlisting}

With this running Multics you can do:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Logging into an Existing Account
    \item Logging in as an Anonymous User
    \item Creating Directories
    \item Listing the Contents of Directories
    \item Entry Names
    \item Editing files (Emas, qedx, edm, Teco)
    \item Printing files
    \item Setting Time Zone
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quick overview of these capabilities will be demonstrated during my presentation}.
